The STATE 2 is based on the technique of Enumeration
In this STATE there are [] procedural level (PL)

a) Identify your IP Address, in particular CLASS, SUBNET, STATIC or DYNAMIC, etc...

b) Scanning IP Addresses in the same SUBNET and create a table containing the Addresses found

c) Scanning Ports for every Addresses found and insert them in the table

d) Scanning Services for every port and insert them in the table


The same procedure must be applied to the addresses of other SUBNETS
The purpose is to create a map of the network containing the active 
services of each individual host to identify its characteristics and classify them as:

1) Client
2) Server
3) An other device

drawing a map divided in:

GREEN: LAN (eth0, eth1)
RED: WAN
BLU: WLAN (wlan0, wlan1)
ORANGE: DMZ
OTHER: (ex dual red)
